# Learning Data Retrieval

This repository provides a beginner-friendly guide to understanding Data Retrieval—essential for building search engines, recommendation systems, and organizing large datasets.

## Key Concepts
- **Document Representation**: How we store data to make searching fast and efficient.
- **Indexing**: Creating structures (like inverted indexes) to speed up data retrieval.
- **Query Processing**: Understanding and refining user queries.
- **Ranking**: Ordering search results based on relevance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring performance with metrics like Precision and Recall.

## Main Techniques
1. **Keyword-based Retrieval**: Finds documents using exact words or phrases.
2. **Vector Space Model**: Measures similarity between queries and documents.
3. **Probabilistic Models**: Calculates relevance based on probability (e.g., BM25).
4. **Semantic Search**: Improves retrieval by understanding the meaning of words.
5. **Machine Learning Models**: Uses algorithms to enhance retrieval accuracy.

## Tools
- **Apache Lucene** and **Elasticsearch**: For search indexing and retrieval.
- **Whoosh**: A simple search engine library in Python.
- **NLTK and SpaCy**: NLP libraries for better query understanding.
- **Gensim**: For document similarity and topic modeling.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Python Libraries**: NLTK, Whoosh, and SpaCy.
2. **Create an Index**: Index your sample dataset for fast retrieval.
3. **Build a Simple Search**: Write functions for processing queries and ranking results.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Test and refine your search system with metrics.
