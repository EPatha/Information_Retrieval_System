**Text Preprocessing of E-Books**:
   - The text data from the converted e-books will be preprocessed using the following techniques:
     - **Tokenization**: Breaking the text into individual words or tokens.
     - **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., "the", "is", etc.) that do not contribute meaningful information.
     - **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form to handle variations (e.g., "improving" becomes "improv").
   - After preprocessing, the text data will be transformed into an **incidence matrix** that represents the relationships between words and topics in the e-books.
