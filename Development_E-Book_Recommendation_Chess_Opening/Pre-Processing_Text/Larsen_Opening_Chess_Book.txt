Move by Move  is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer format. One 
of our main aims of the series is to replicat e – as much as possible – lessons between chess 
teachers and students. 
All the way through, readers will be challenged  to answer searching questions, to test 
their skills in chess openings and indeed in other key aspects of the game. It’s our firm be-
lief that practising your skills like this is an excellent way to study chess openings, and to 
study chess in general. 
Many thanks go to all those who have been kind  enough to offer inspiration, advice and 
assistance in the creation of Move by Move . We’re really excited by this series and hope that 
readers will share our enthusiasm.

In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the Buddha asks : “Can you count, compare, measure, con-
ceive, imagine, perceive, touch or divide the principle of spac e? Can you approach, reach or 
attain space? Can space even be described as  infinite?” When you begin a chess game with 
1 b3, your opponents soon discover that they go to war against a ghost and engage in bat-
tles against empty space. If the universe is infinite, then it stands to reason that every pos-
sibility – both physical and imagined – must  find expression in a manifestation some-
where out there. The Nimzo-Larsen Attack is an opening which fits this theory. 
Chess is that strange realm where dimensions of form and that of imagination interre-
late and mesh. We play 1 b3, a harmless li ttle move, allowing Black a blank canvas, with 
scope to set up any way he or she desires. On  our very first move we challenge the forces of 
orthodoxy, who claim that we must enter a trendy theoretical li ne to claim our birthright 
White advantage. In fact, we cede this point and instead engage in one-on-one combat on 
raw chess skill, virtually circumventing the entire opening phase (well, apart from some of 
the super-sharp 1...e5 lines of the first three ch apters in this book!). After 1 b3, prepare to 
enter realms where book knowledge grows vagu e, and where we must survive only by su-
perior adaptability to the constantly shifting structures. In fact, our entire association with 
the opening phase (with the exception of a few forcing variations) grows so tenuous that it 
 
 
   
 
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack: Move by Move 
8 virtually disappears. With our first move we give license to free reign on creativity—both 
ours and our opponent’s. Immediately after our first move, our future appears as a vacant 
lot. It is actually our opponent’s response whic h tells us what to build on that lot. We make 
our way through strange terrain of multit udinous possibilities, diverse futures. 
The Nimzo-Larsen isn’t as much an opening as it is a composite of other openings and 
structural possibilities. In hypermodern fashion – a necessary article of faith for our line – 
we often allow Black to take over the centre with ...e7-e5 and ...d7-d5, only to attack it later 
from the sides, and especially pressure it fr om the vantage point of our fianchettoed b2-
bishop. Conquest of the central dark squares can be a key criterion of the Nimzo-Larsen. 
 
We are our own Messiah  
The tendency these days is to look for an open ings messiah, order his or her books and then 
faithfully practice the holy teachings. We di saffected Nimzo-Larseners, on the other hand, 
are sick and tired of waiting around. So we as sume the role of our own openings messiah. 
This book is meant to be a block of suggest ions and ideas, not commands to be followed. 
Most of us tend to play better within a famili ar structure. When you open with 1 b3!, more 
than likely you alone will be within the famili ar after a dozen or so moves, while your op-
ponents will wander about, strangers to the al ien environments which tend to arise from 
the Nimzo-Larsen. 
I view my books as a joint venture in which yo u, the reader, and I participate. So I never 
accept an opening book contract unless I am willing to play the opening myself. I expected 
to take a hit in rating when I first took up 1 b3. In fact in my very first game, I groaned in-wardly when I barely drew with a player rate d 450 points lower. Then, as I studied and un-
derstood the opening more, events began to turn around. 
In this book you are offered a host of idiosync ratic ideas and flights of fancy – over safer, 
more solid lines – and I encourage readers to follow their imaginations when playing 1 b3. 
At this writing, my score with the opening st ands at 25 wins, four draws and a loss, from 
an opposition rated around a 2250 average – a far higher percentage than normal scores 
with my main 1 Ìf3 or 1 d4 lines. Out of these ga mes I achieved very few “+=” positions 
after the opening, and in most games my opponents equalized (and sometimes stood bet-
ter!). Yet their troubles arose from the middlegame on. So what was the game changer? Opponents tended to react poorly to the bizarri fication of the positi ons, ate up too much 
time on their clocks and bega n to grow disoriented, which in turn, induced inexplicable 
errors from such strong players. Don’t unde restimate the weaponization of the outlandish!

In this position, the Nimzo-Larsen Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, I had White against GM 
Tamaz Gelashvili at the National Open rapid chess championship. The opening went 1 b3 
d5 2 Íb2 Í g4 3 f3!? Íf5 4 e4!?. Now my scary strong opponent, rated USCF 2668, later 
outplayed me but I hung on to the draw anyway , mainly because he burned so much of his 
clock dealing with a completely new set of opening problems, whereas I banged out my moves quickly. Why? Because we cover this po sition in Chapter Seven . So what is bizarre 
and unfamiliar to the opponent is merely routine, familiar ground for us, the Nimzo-
Larsen clan. 
 
The Division of the Book  
The book is, in a sense, dissected into two gi gantic chapters: 1 b3 e5 lines, and 1 b3 and 
everything else lines! Chapters  One, Two and Three, the largest in the book, cover the con-
frontational 1...e5 variations, which you do in deed need to study and, yes, even memorize 
parts of, since the lines tend to be forcing and quite mathematical. It is in these lines that 
we are vulnerable to home prep and a crafty  opponent’s computer analysis, so we must 
work hardest here in the book. Nevertheless, ther e is still plenty of room for imagination to 
frolic. Then we have Chapters Four through Ten, 1 b3 versus everything else. These lines 
tend not to engage in early confrontation, and therefore allow us to do some really strange 
things, which I, your enabler, encourage throughout the book! 
 
The History of the Nimzo-Larsen  
In the 1920s and 30s, Aaron Nimzowitsc h scored over 80% with 1 b3, and 1 Ìf3, 2 b3. Sur-
prisingly, he played the latter 1 Ìf3 move order far more often than the purist 1 b3 ver-
sion. He mostly got reversed Nimzo-Indian posi tions, as examined in  Chapter Five, which 
he understood more deeply than  virtually all his opponents. 
Larsen, too, did very well with his namesake opening, scoring an impressive 80%, main-
ly with the 1 b3 move order. Yet, paradoxica lly, our opening was hit with a terrible setback 
 
 
   
 
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack: Move by Move 
10 setback from a public relations standpoint, when then world champi on Boris Spassky dis-
mantled our hero, Larsen in a mere 17 moves in a high-stakes game at the USSR vs. Rest of 
the World match in Belgrade, 1970. It was painfu l to watch and not much of a contest. On 
the one side we observed a salivating cat and on the other a quaking hamster. Somehow 
this massacre embedded itself in our collect ive consciousness and now most players asso-
ciate 1 b3?! with the Larsen-Spassky debacle. I have cunningly hidden this game, embedded somewhere in the notes of the book and refuse  to annotate this embarrassment – unless, 
of course, I end up writing Spassky: Move by Move ! (In which case I would no doubt extol 
and wax poetically over the glories of Spassky’s sumptuous attacking skills!) 
Fischer, in an experimental mood, took up the opening’s ma ntle in the early 70s, rack-
ing up a perfect 5-0 score, an act which inje cted our Nimzo-Larsen spirits with a consider-
able boost of confidence – although most pl ayers didn’t attribute Fischer’s success to the 
powers of the Nimzo-Larsen itself, since at th e time Fischer slaughtered opponents at un-
heard-of margins with every opening. Then th ere followed four decades of dormancy – a 
lengthy convalescence period (to recover from the Larsen-Spassky game!) – where our opening was left untouched, like rotten cheese past its expiration date, by the upper eche-
lon of chess. 
 
A New, Hallucinatory Era for 1 b3!  
Fortunately, a violin doesn’t lose its tone if le ft unplayed by a maestro for a long period of 
time. In the present, our hibe rnating opening awakens to its old power and glory, none the 
worse for its disuse. Today, we arrive upon th e threshold of a new era for our opening. Ar-
menian GM Tigran L. Petrosian and Georgian  super-GM – rated over 2700 – Baadur Jobaba 
play 1 b3 regularly and with success. Modern GM s interpret the opening in a kind of high-
end crazy formulation, inspiring a new generati on of Nimzo-Larseners. Their play sparkles 
with anticipatory, child-like freshness, as we  try and guess (almost always incorrectly!) 
their coming moves. 
When the Duke of Wellington was asked what his orders were in case he was killed in 
the Battle of Waterloo, he responded: “To do like  me!” And so now we steal a glimpse of our 
top general’s modern interpreta tions of our line. (I sneaked in a diagram of one of my 
games as well. Okay, fine, I’m not included in  the list of top Nimzo-Larsen generals, but I 
certainly qualify as newly enlisted  zealot in our war!) Here is just a taste of some of the po-
sitions examined in the coming chapters. In ea ch case White submerges himself in fanciful 
notions and dark alchemies and, in each ca se, White, the Nimzo-La rsener, functions and 
pushes forward upon the wind of a fundamenta lly optimistic premise: I will survive the 
complications and you, my bewildered opponent , won’t – and in each case they were cor-
rect! Behold that hallucinatory, strategy-les s netherworld, called the Nimzo-Larsen, where 
all futures are possible:

Lakdawala-Krishnan (Game 33) 
 
A quick glance at these diagrams and one would believe the book was titled: The Grob: 
Move by Move ! The modern interpretation of the Nimzo-Larsen is a virtual Ìc3/g2-g4-fest! 
To the naked eye, it appears as if White’s forc es in the above positi ons lie about in disor-
derly array, like obese sunbathing tourists littered about the beach. In each case, White 
unscrews the lid, and allows an archy and unblocked creativity to pour forth and splash as 
it may. 
Conversely, watch how Nimzowitsch’s greate r understanding of the structure guides 
him to the win in the following game: 
 
  
Game 1 
A.Nimzowitsch-H.Johner  
Exhibition game, Bern 1931   
1 Ìf3  
  
Question:  Doesn’t the Nimzo-Larsen begin with 1 b3 - ? 
  
Answer:  Technically, yes, but some players start the game with 1 Ìf3 and 2 b3. In this book, 
the vast majority of the games do indeed begin with 1 b3!. 
  
Question:  Why would White want to avoid the 1 b3 move order? 
  
 
 
   
 
Introduction 
13 Answer:  It has the effect of cutting out Black’ s sharpest and most theoretical response 
1...e5, whose lines we covered for nearly half the book. Which means it is also possible to 
play the Nimzo-Larsen à la carte. 1...Ìf6 2 b3

There we go. Radical stuff back in 1931. Th e hypermodern’s philosophy: a preposterous 
notion (allow the opponent to take control of the centre, to later attack it from the wings) 
ceases to bear that label if it can also prove its effectiveness. Sometimes we play a shocking 
move (yes, 2 b3 was shocking in 1931), not for it s inherent power, as much as for the sheer 
exhilaration of it. 
2...d5  
In the 1920s and 30s virtually every one tossed in the classical ...d7-d5 response at some 
point or another. All but a few radical hypermod erns challenged the theory that physically 
controlling the centre with your pawns was always a positive venture. 
3 Íb2 c5 4 e3 Ìc6 5 Íb5 
Reaching a reversed Nimzo-Indian, which we cover extensively in Chapter Five. 
5...Í g4 
Not a great line for Black, who usually gets ro bbed of the bishop pair  in this version. We 
cover 5...Ë c7, 5...Í d7 and 5...a6 responses in Chapter Five. 
6 Íxc6+ 
  
Question:  Should White wait for ...a7-a6 before swapping on c6? 
  
Answer:  Not normally. White often takes on c6 unprovoked in this line. However, he can 
delay by tossing in 6 h3 Íh5?! (I think this natural move almost gives White a winning po-
sition; I suppose Black can change his mind and play 6... Íd7 which would hand White a 
not terribly useful tempo with h2-h3, whereas 6... Íxf3 7 Íxc6+ bxc6 8 Ëxf3 gives White a 
pleasant structural edge without the cost of the bishop pair) 7 g4 Íg6 8 Ìe5 Îc8 9 h4! 
 
 
   
 
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack: Move by Move 
14 (White herds pawns to make the structure pliable to his wishes, threatening 10 h5 Íe4 11 
f3) 9...d4 (9...h5? 10 Ìxg6 fxg6 11 g5 Ìd7 is strategically nauseati ng for Black, who nurses 
an awful pawn structure on the kingside, is weak on the light squares, and has handed 
White the bishop pair – normally Black’s birthright in the r eversed Nimzo-Indian) 10 Ìxc6 
bxc6 11 Ía6 Îb8 12 h5 Í e4 13 f3 with a clear structural su periority to White, E.Dizdarevic-
I.Kinez, Pula 1996. 
6...bxc6 7 h3 Íxf3?! 
Now White has damaged the opposing queenside for free. At least 7... Íh5 8 g4 (White 
can also play more quietly with 8 d3 h6 9 Ìbd2) 8...Í g6 9 Ìe5 Ìd7 10 Ìxg6 hxg6 gets 
Black an open h-file in exchange for the bishop.

9...e6  
  
Question:  Why didn’t Black play 9...e5 instead? 
  
Answer:  It violates the principle: Avoid fixing pawns on the same  colour as your remaining 
bishop.  White seizes the advantage after 10 Ëg3 Ìd7 11 e4 Î b8 12 Ìc3 Ë d6. And 12...d4?! 
13 Ìb1! is even better for White, who now controls c4, may later target c5, and is free to 
consider both f2-f4 and c2-c3 pawn breaks. 
10 Ìc3  
  
Question:  Why can’t White win a pawn here? 
  
Answer:  It isn’t worth the loss of initiative after 10 Íxf6?! gxf6 11 Ëxf6 Îg8 12 Ë f3 Íg7 13 
c3 a5. 
10...Í d6 11 Ìa4  
 
 
   
 
Introduction 
15 Giving notice to Black that c5 is a weak pawn. 
11...Í e5 
Reminding White that control over e5 is a pr ivilege, not a right. Swaps hurt Black, but 
he had to do something about the b2-bishop’s eternal gaze upon f6. 
  
Question:  Can Black dissolve the weakness with 11...c4 - ? 
  
Answer:  He merely trades one problem for another after 12 Íxf6 gxf6 13 dxc4 dxc4 14 0-0 
f5 15 e4 fxe4 16 Ëxe4 cxb3 17 cxb3, when Black’s pawns – especially c6 – are weak, and his 
king looks somewhat insecure as well. 
12 Íxe5 Ëxe5 13 0-0 Ìd7 14 Ëe2!? 
Nimzowitsch wants to slide his queen over to the other side of the board in search of 
targets. Today’s GMs would undoubtedly play 14 c4, fixing the target on c5. 14...0-0 15 Ëd2!? f5 
Black hopes to get something cooking on the kingside to distract White from the other 
wing. 15...a5!? was also possible, keeping White’ s queen off that square, albeit at the cost 
of a tempo. 
16 Ëa5! 
With this move, Nimzo sends his opponent a message. Not a loud one, but enough to 
indicate just who is in control of the position. 16...Î fb8 
Instinct, the more powerful force, generally overrides logic in time s of crisis. With his 
last move Black decides to play for high stakes, refusing to play a defensive move like 16...Ë d6.

Exercise (critical decision/calculation):  Calculate the ramifications of 17 Ìxc5 Îb5  
18 Ìxd7 Ëxa1. Sinister emanations pour forth from c5. Can White take it or not? 
  
 
 
   
 
The Nimzo-Larsen Attack: Move by Move 
16 Answer:  White has seen deeper into th e position and the move works. 
17 Ìxc5!!  
White’s knight frolics about in high spirit s, the way your dog acts when you return 
home from a trip. In such positions our likes and dislikes are discarde d variables. In math-
based calculations, there is but a single solution to the equation. 
17...Î b5 18 Ìxd7 Ëxa1 19 Ëc7! Ëc3 20 a4!  
Nimzo implements an inestima bly crucial component to White’s sequence. The rook is 
chased to a tactically vulnerable square. Th ose who were aggressors suddenly find them-
selves in the role of the assailed. It becomes clear that defence of Black’s offside rook will 
prove to be an enormous drain on his resources. 
20...Î b4 
A move which attests to Black’s extreme level of desperation. For now, the rook loafs 
about and runs idle, like a computer monitor on sleep mode. Instead: 
a) 20...Î a5? (this awkward move is slow death for Black) 21 d4! h6 22 Ìe5 Êh8 23 Ìg6+ 
Êg8 24 Ìf4 Îe8 25 Ìh5 mates. Veni vidi vici. In this way White breaks up an oversized, 
unmanageable whole into scattered, weakened  chunks. There is no way to protect g7. 
b) 20...Ë a5? 21 Ëxc6 Îbb8 22 Ìxb8 Îxb8 23 Ë xe6+ Êh8 24 Ë xf5. White continues to 
siphon off extraneous black pawns and regains the exchange with four pawns’ interest. 
21 Ìe5!

Nimzo strangles Johner’s joy with each pa ssing move. He threatens c6, as well as Ëf7+, 
followed by Ëxe6. White’s attacking queen and knight team swim into the nervous black 
king’s line of sight. 21...Î f8

first grade child knows: 25 Ìh6+ Êh8 26 Ë g8+ Îxg8 27 Ìf7 mate) 25 Ìh6+ Êf8 26 Ëxf6+ 
 
 
   
 
Introduction 
17 gxf6 27 Ìxf5 and White should convert with three pawns for the exchange. 
22 Ìxc6  
Threatening Ìe7+ with a discovered attack  on Black’s loose queen. 
22...Ê h8 
“This too shall pass,” thinks Black’s king of the new wave of White’s attack. Unfortu-
nately, he is mistaken and his position reache s terminal proportions. Johner by now surely 
realizes he is caught under the thra ll of a power greater than his own.

Black nurtures a final, lone hope for surviv al – a daydream more than a hope. But his 
last move overlooks a lethal potential. We sens e a foreboding, an absolute finality on the 
horizon, as a cat’s face appears to the goldfish in the bowl. 
  
Exercise (combination alert):  Find one move and  
you force Black’s immediate resignation. 
  
Answer:  Double attack. No need for sparkling tactics when inertia does all the work. 
23 Ëd6! 1-0 
Summary:  Against the set-up ...d7-d5, ...c7-c5 and ...Ìc6, we get a reversed Nimzo-Indian.

199 chief’s insult to his enemy from The Last of the Mohicans : “Reed that bends...the enemy 
know the shape of your back, but they have never seen the colo ur of your eyes. Your name 
will never be mentioned again in your tribe – it is already forgotten.” 
If instead 23...Ë g8 (the queen enters her room and slams the door behind her – her ser-

Material begins to hang, as a sad co rollary to Black’s earlier decisions. 
25...Î xc8 26 Î d5! 1-0 
After 26... Íd6 27 Ìxb6, we see the true measure of Bl ack’s misery as Fischer’s pieces 
crawl in like ants in jam. 
Summary:  Play the 3 c4 move order if you have ex perience with the Scheveningen Sicilian 
structure as Black. 
 
  
Game 30 
R.J.Fischer-U.Andersson 
Exhibition game, Siegen 1970   
In the realm of human achievement, Fischer – psychosis aside – sits among the likes of 
da Vinci and Mozart in his field. Games like this remind us why.

Still waiting for ...d7-d5 to appear! 
  
Question:  And if Black refuses to play ...d7-d5, then what? 
  
Answer:  Then we get something similar to Larse n-Andersson from Chapter Two (Game 20), 
a much slower strategic fight.

Question:  What differentiates this posi tion from Fischer-Tukmakov? 
  
Answer:  Tukmakov played the loosening but more aggressive ...f7-f5. In this game Anders-
son, true to his nature, plays the super soli d ...f7-f6, come-and-get-me formation. He also 
tossed in ...a7-a5, which weakens b5 but cons trains White’s queenside ambitions by pre-
venting b3-b4 expansion ideas.

“Faith and begorrah!” I muttered to myself, wh ile trying to puzzle out Fischer’s intent 
when I first played over this game at the ag e of 10. (Which admittedl y is a bit odd, since I 
am Indian, not Irish. But I was trying to imitat e Chief O’Hara, the Irish Gotham City Chief of 
Police from the 1960s’ Batman TV show.)

Question:  A random move from White rewarded  
with a double exclamation mark? Please explain. 
  
Answer:  A completely new plan of immense grav ity and far-reaching consequences takes 
birth. The double exclam was for the originality of the idea: White plans Îg1 and g2-g4, 
after which his knight has free reign over e4 , as well as a potential attack. Today, every 
Scheveningen, Najdorf, Kan and Taimanov Sicilian pla yer is aware of such  a plan, thanks to 
Fischer. Of course, it entails risk for White as well, since he voluntarily weakens his own 
king. But think about this: the only way for Black to disrupt this plan is  to pry open the cen-
tre – not so easy, since Black’s central structure is rigid for now. 
13...Ë d7 
Clearing a path for ...Î ad8 and making it more difficult  for White to engineer g2-g4.

Question:  Why did Andersson allow White g2-g4 after all? 
  
Answer:  I have a feeling Andersson welcomed the g- pawn thrust and didn’t trust Fischer’s 
plan. Black pays a structural price if he attempts to thwart the plan. For example, 15... Ìb6 
16 Ìfd2 and now if Black takes the nuclear option  and tosses in 16...f5!?, there is a high 
cost to his king’s safety:

a) 17 Ìc5! Íxc5 18 Ëxc5 e4 19 g4!? exd3 (19...f4!? 20 Ìxe4 Íxb3 21 Ë g5 favours

Genius is not always bound to precepts. In this case Fischer deliberately violates the 
principle: Avoid weakening your king’s pawn front.  Such decisions are played with irre-
versible intent: come and get me before I get you. 16...g6!? 
 
 
Question:  Why did Black weaken himsel f down the a1-h8 diagonal? 
  
Answer:  Black probably played the move for the following reasons: 
1. He feared g4-g5, and if ...f6-f5, then White may have a g5-g6 zwischenzug which 
clears g5 for a knight. 
2. If White played a future Ìh4, it may have provoked ...g7-g6 anyway. 
3. Black may feel a bit safer if  he has a chance to play ... Íg7, although this would leave 
c5 for the e4-knight. 
17 Îg3! 
White hopes to procure provisions for a long campaign by transferring resources to the 
kingside. By lifting the rook, he  clears the way for the a1-rook.

determinate. The black king’s safety and Wh ite’s surrounding forces weigh evenly on the 
scale – until:

Question:  I fail to understand the purpose of White’s  
massive build-up on the g-file . Where is his breakthrough? 
  
Answer:  Up to now, White’s kingside forays have on ly had the effect of nettling Black, more 
than inflicting any real damage. So let’ s turn this question  into an exercise: 
  
Exercise (planning): Black’s last move was an error and now, imperceptibly, White’s 
strategic pressure yields dividends. Ho w can White make significant progress? 
  Answer:  Fischer’s tactic enables him to eliminat e a key defender of the dark squares. 
22 Ìf5!  
What began as a once promising defensive ba rrier suddenly displays signs of a poten-
tial rout. Now the attack surges forth, as if with a life of its own. 
22...Í e6 
22...gxf5?? loses to 23 gxf5 Íxf5 24 Îxg7+ Ëxg7 25 Ìxf6+! (this zwischenzug destroys 
Black) 25... Êf7 26 Îxg7+ Êxg7 27 Ìxe8+. 
23 Ìc5 Ìe7? 
Now something just doesn’t feel right in Bl ack’s position, the same way a tiger gazes 
upon a raw slab of meat, swinging suspiciously  from a rope in the forest. Black should try 
to minimize his disadvantage with 23... Ìd7 24 Ìxe6 Ëxe6 25 d4! (threatening Íc4) 
25...Ìb6 26 dxe5 fxe5 27 Ìxg7 Êxg7 28 f4, when Black remains in an unpleasant but still 
playable position. 24 Ìxg7  
The old black dark-squared bishop, condemne d for heresy, distressingly finds himself

204 tied to a flaming stake, unable even  to cross himself in his agony. 
24...Ê xg7 
The trouble with 24... Ëxg7? is that White can simply take on b7 now with 25 Ìxb7 
Íd5+ 26 Í f3. 
25 g5  
Of course. Fischer ruthlessly tears down the already weakened dark squares around An-
dersson’s king. 
25...Ìf5 26 Îf3 b6 27 gxf6+ Êh8! 
Black’s only hope is to use White’s f6-pawn as a shield. 27... Ëxf6?? 28 Ìe4 Ëe7 29

Black’s defenders remain in a loose confeder ation of disconsolate clusters, all vulner-
able, all ineffective. 
  
Exercise (planning): Find a forcing way to  
increase White’s already significant advantage. 
  
Answer:  Principle:  Open the position when you own the bishop pair.

In a situation of macabre foreboding, Black’s helpless king can do no more than glare 
melancholy accusation at the growing number of attackers gathering around him. Secur-
ing immediate victory is a moment’s work, but only if you work out the combination. 
  
Exercise (combination alert):  Fischer’s next move, 35 h4, is winning  
but not the best. The g-file represents  a potential gateway into Black’s  
position. The question is: how can Whit e enlarge the aperture of entry?  
  
35 h4  
Answer:  Three conspirators in on one secret are two too many. The secret, now leaked be-
comes common knowledge: The key is rook entry to g7, after which all hell breaks loose for 
Black. In one sweeping motion the blockade falls, and with it all hardship is abolished for 
White: 35 Îxf5! gxf5 36 Îg7 Ëe8 37 f7! (the long diagonal is cleared, threatening Îg8 ma-
te with double check!) 37... Ìxg7 (now the f7-pawn, effervesce nt with joy, achieves her aim: 
the death of her sister and he r own promotion to queen) 38 fxe8 Ë+ Îxe8 39 Ë f7 Îg8 40
