  Introduction 7The Sicilian Defense is one of the most complex and powerful defenses 
available to Black, and it duly remains the choice of many top players as their favorite response to 1.e4. Historically, it has mainly been believed 
that the critical test of this opening was to attack it directly via the Open Sicilian, which occurs after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, opening up the center. The dynamics of the resulting positions are such that White will get a lead in development while Black will have an extra central pawn. This leads to incredibly sharp middlegames as both sides try to make use of their advantages. 
Throughout this book we will attempt to either transform White’s lead in 
development into a devastating kingside attack, or choose a more positional approach, playing for strategic pluses such as having extra space or a healthier pawn structure. 
However, our ambitious approach is not without risk; often, the first player 
to err or lose the thread of the struggle will be quickly punished. It is no surprise that the Sicilian is one of the most popular openings around—it offers Black great potential not just to equalize, but to fight for victory as well! If you feel that you are up to the challenge and interested in pursuing the sharpest way of meeting the Sicilian Defense, then we have written this book for you.
In our humble opinion we believe that the modern philosophy of opening 
study is to blend the opening and middlegame stages together. Nowadays most professional players make their opening decisions based on the kinds of middlegame positions that they would like to reach. They then study the ins and outs of those middlegames as much (if not more) as the specific moves of each opening. Introduction XIIIIIIIIY

1.e4 c5 2.Nf3
8 IntroductionThis is exactly what we believe is the best approach to building an opening 
repertoire. True mastery of the opening occurs when a player knows the 
specific theory and understands the future complexities of the structure. After all, what good is it to get a decent position out of the opening if you have no idea what to do with it afterwards? 
With this in mind, our main goal in choosing lines to recommend was to 
reach middlegame positions with well-defined plans for both sides. We then hope to illustrate how to handle a typical middlegame in each variation through the use of instructive games.  
The purpose of this book is not only to provide a complete repertoire for 
the White side of the Open Sicilian, but also to ingrain a number of thematic positional and tactical motifs as well. 
After analyzing hundreds of high-level games for this book, we chose only the most instructive to feature, and included many others in variations. 
Studying each game in depth will definitely broaden your understanding of the Open Sicilian, as well as your understanding of chess as a whole. In addition to providing you with the latest theory, each game also includes a variety of common strategic topics, such as the initiative, positional sacrifices, weak squares, outposts, advantage of the two bishops, pawn storms, opposite side castling—but of course!, positional binds, restriction, and prophylaxis, to name a few. We hope to provide you with meaningful insight as to what it takes to manage the White side of the Open Sicilian successfully.
We’d also like to take this opportunity to manage your expectations. We 
cannot promise a huge advantage in every line—if that was the case then the Sicilian would certainly not be one of Black’s most reliable openings among all levels! The truth is that many of the main lines remain perfectly playable for Black, but that doesn’t mean that the well-prepared player shouldn’t be optimistic about his or her chances. We have armed you with top notch analysis as well as a repertoire of strategic plans and ideas that you will be able to rely on deep into the middlegame. As is almost always the case, when two players are equally matched in their opening knowledge it will be the player with the better understanding of the ensuing middlegame who will have the upper hand.
While computers remain a trusted ally in the world of opening analysis, 
it is important not to rely on the silicon beast too much. We’ve analyzed and checked each line with the strongest engines available, and while you shouldn’t hesitate to verify our analysis, we hope that you’ll avoid the novice mistake of depending on the computer’s opinion too much. 
The ideal way to study this book is to play each move out on a physical 
chess board—actually moving the pieces with your hand should increase your retention of the material and allow you to absorb more in the long run. 
With that, we’d like to wish you the best of luck on your journey and we 
sincerely thank you for giving us the opportunity to help you improve.

To this day, the Najdorf Sicilian remains one of the most popular openings in 
all of chess, and for good reason. Named after legendary Grandmaster Miguel Najdorf, this combative opening was a favorite choice of none other than Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, as well as countless of other Grandmasters. With that in mind, we’ve decided to start our courageous journey here. 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.h3
The 6.h3 variation has been 
dubbed the Adams Attack, attributed to American master 
Weaver Adams, who first played the line in the 1940s. 20 years later, Fischer then used it to success in games against Reshevsky, Bolbochan, and even Najdorf himself! Despite this, the variation was not considered as challenging as the more popular 6.Be3 or 6.Bg5 up until just a few years ago, when suddenly many top players started including it in their repertoire. 
Nowadays, this line is hotly 
contested at high levels, and has been used more than once by super-GMs Carlsen, Anand, Nakamura, Karjakin, Svidler, and Nepomniachtchi, among others. 
In the following chapter we 
will see White advance g2-g4 and fianchetto the light-squared bishop, which will act as a force to be reckoned with along the long diagonal. Additionally, the g-pawn will also play a vital role in many middlegames, often contributing to a kingside attack.
Chapter 1a will be dedicated to the 
flexible 6...e6 , Chapter 1b will feature 
6...e5 , and Chapter 1c will include all 
of Black’s less popular options, such as 6...Nc6  and 6...g6 , as well as the 
Scheveningen Variation, which starts with 5...e6 .

We start this chapter with Black’s most flexible response to our seemingly innocuous 6th move. This is the move you are most likely to face over the 
board, as Black’s options are still wide open in terms of development. 
After the natural 7.g4 , Black has mainly chosen between 7...d5 , 7...b5 , 
7...Be7 , and 7...h6 . We will cover each of these responses in depth in six 
instructive games, highlighting dozens of plans and ideas along the way. 
One thing to watch out for in this chapter will be the various move order 
transpositions in certain lines, which can get tricky and will often bear repeating. In our view, the best way to deal with any confusion is to play through each variation on a chess board several times, as this process will help you retain more information.1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.h3 e6 7.g4

It is logical to start our investi -
gation with this line, as it is a very 
direct answer to our ambitious plan of 6.h3 and 7.g4. Black moves the d-pawn for the second time in order to create tension in the center and exploit White’s kingside expansion.8.exd5 Nxd5 
Now Black threatens Nxc3, and 
White should avoid the doubled c-pawns unless it comes at the price of Black’s dark-squared bishop, which can often be an advantageous trade for us.9.Nde2

This move has been favored by 
most major proponents of 6.h3, such 
as Anand, Nepomniachtchi, and Vachier-Lagrave. White defends the knight and threatens to leave Black with an isolated queen pawn by means of Nxd5.
Less common is 9.Bd2, but it has 
been played a number of times by strong players. We dislike it since it does not create the threat Nxd5 and allows Black to develop more freely. For instance, 9...b5 seems to be quite reasonable for Black.9...Bb4
This is by far the most popular 
and natural move—Black develops, puts more pressure on c3, and prevents Nxd5. Let’s take a look at some of Black’s lesser attempts for equality:
9...Nxc3?!  leads to a slightly 
worse endgame for Black with no chances of winning, not exactly something a Najdorf player strives for! 10.Qxd8+ Kxd8 11.Nxc3 Bd7. The main attempt to equalize, trying to neutralize White’s powerful light-squared bishop. White can fight for the advantage with simple moves:

548 ConclusionWe hope this book was as enjoyable to read as it was to write. Over the 
process of many months we discovered many wonderful ideas and came 
away with a better understanding of not only the Sicilian Defense, but of chess itself. Our goal was to provide you, dear reader, with a full repertoire against Black’s most combative opening, as well as an arsenal of positional and tactical motifs to boot. 
If we could leave you with a few words of advice, we’d stress that in order 
to truly absorb all of the material covered in this book, one must put it into practice and develop an intuitive feel for the ensuing positions. Being well-prepared is one thing, but being well-experienced is another.
Thus, we cannot recommend enough the practical value of training games. 
Find someone to play the Black side of a line, and challenge them to a few games to test out your knowledge. 
We often feel ready to employ certain openings, but once we get to the board 
we are surprised by our lack of feeling for the position. Whenever you try a new opening, it is important to first test it out in training in order to build up experience and confidence. One of the best ways of improving is to analyze your own games—find your strengths, weaknesses, and further your chess knowledge!
We sincerely wish you all the best.
