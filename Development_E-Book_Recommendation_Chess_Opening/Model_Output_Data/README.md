# Decision Tree Model for Chess Opening Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze personal chess gameplay data by focusing on the effectiveness of various opening strategies. By using a decision tree model, we can evaluate opening moves, identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide insights on optimal strategies based on past game outcomes.

## Model Output: Decision Tree
The model outputs a decision tree that categorizes different chess openings and their likely results (Win, Lose, Draw) based on historical gameplay data. Each branch of the tree represents decision points influenced by factors such as:

- **Opening Popularity**: A measure of how frequently each opening is played.
- **Win Rate**: The success rate of each opening for the player.
- **Move Accuracy**: Evaluates the precision of moves played within a given opening.
- **Player Rating**: Incorporates the player's rating at the time of each game to adjust for skill level.

The decision tree model helps by visualizing decision paths for openings and highlights key points that lead to wins or losses. This information can be used for targeted improvement in specific openings or move sequences.

## How the Model Works
1. **Data Collection**: The raw dataset (in PGN format) from Chess.com is processed and converted to Excel for structured analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features are extracted, including results, moves, opening type, and accuracy.
3. **Training the Decision Tree**: The model uses game data to train the decision tree, focusing on the variables that impact game outcomes.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The decision tree is evaluated to measure accuracy, helping to ensure reliable recommendations for opening strategies.

## Sample Output
Below is a simplified example of the decision tree output:
